# Dotfiles

On ubuntu machine:

1. Run sudo apt install git
1. git clone https://github.com/viktomas/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
1. cd ~/.dotfiles
1. ./ubuntu-install-basic.sh
1. ./install.sh

## Bin

It's a good idea to start all the scripts with comma, so I can easily autocomplete only my personal commands https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2009/commands-with-comma/ .

## Crontab

Edit crontab by running `./bin/edit-crontab.sh`.

## Git

- Configured to use different `.gitconfig` for work and private repos based on [How to use different git emails Â· Hao's learning log](https://blog.hao.dev/how-to-use-different-git-emails-for-personal-and-work-repositories-on-the-same-machine)
